# Multi-zone-Mesh-Combiner-for-SU2
A python script for combining multiple native SU2 format meshes into one mesh file for multi-zone simulations.

Run the python script in the directory your mesh files are located and follow the instructions.

Example;

_Please enter the zone number\n
3
Please enter the name for the combined mesh file with its extension.
If it does not exist, it will be created
total.su2
Please enter the name of the Zone 1 mesh file with its extension;
zone1.su2
Please enter the name of the Zone 2 mesh file with its extension;
zone2.su2
Please enter the name of the Zone 3 mesh file with its extension;
zone3.su2
Combined mesh file creation is SUCCESFUL!_
