A python script for combining multiple native SU2 format meshes into one mesh file for multi-zone simulations.

Run the python script in the directory your mesh files are located and follow the instructions.

Example;

_Please enter the zone number_

_3_

_Please enter the name for the combined mesh file with its extension.
If it does not exist, it will be created_

_total.su2_

_Please enter the name of the Zone 1 mesh file with its extension;_

_exampleZone1.su2_

_Please enter the name of the Zone 2 mesh file with its extension;_

_exampleZone2.su2_

_Please enter the name of the Zone 3 mesh file with its extension;_

_exampleZone3.su2_

_Combined mesh file creation is SUCCESFUL!_
